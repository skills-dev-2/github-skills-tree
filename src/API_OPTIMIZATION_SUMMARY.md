# GitHub API Optimization Summary

## Problem Statement
The application was exceeding GitHub's unauthenticated API rate limit of 60 requests per hour. With 54 exercises, the initial load alone required ~56 API calls, leaving almost no room for reaction data or future growth.

## Optimization Strategies Implemented

### 1. **Lazy Loading for Reactions** ðŸŽ¯
- **Before**: GitHub reactions were loaded for all exercises on initial load
- **After**: Reactions only load when a dialog is explicitly opened
- **Impact**: Reduces initial API calls by up to 108 calls (2 per exercise: issue + reactions)
- **Code**: Modified `useGitHubReactions` hook with `shouldFetch` parameter

### 2. **Batched File Processing** ðŸ“¦
- **Before**: All file content was fetched simultaneously
- **After**: Files are processed in batches of 10 with 100ms delays between batches
- **Impact**: More controlled API usage, reduces server load spikes
- **Code**: Implemented batch processing in `useExercises` and `usePaths` hooks

### 3. **Optimized Directory Traversal** ðŸ”„
- **Before**: Recursive function calls for each subdirectory
- **After**: Level-by-level directory processing with single API calls per directory
- **Impact**: Reduces redundant API calls and improves error handling
- **Code**: Rewritten `fetchAllExercisesRecursively` and `fetchAllPathsRecursively`

### 4. **Aggressive Caching Strategy** ðŸ’¾
- **Static Content**: 4-hour cache for repository contents and file content
- **Dynamic Content**: 30-minute cache for issue reactions and comments
- **Raw Files**: 4-hour cache for JSON file downloads (no API rate limits)
- **Impact**: Subsequent visits use cached data, dramatically reducing API calls

### 5. **API Usage Monitoring** ðŸ“Š
- Added real-time API usage monitoring component
- Shows current usage, remaining calls, and reset time
- Helps developers track optimization effectiveness
- Available as a developer setting in the filter panel

## Expected API Call Reduction

### Initial Load (First Visit)
- **Before**: ~56 API calls for exercises/paths + up to 108 for reactions = ~164 calls
- **After**: ~10-20 API calls for directory listings + file content (cached for 4 hours)
- **Reduction**: ~85-90% reduction in API calls

### Subsequent Visits (Within Cache Window)
- **Before**: Full reload of all data
- **After**: All data served from cache (0 API calls)
- **Reduction**: 100% reduction

### Dialog Interactions
- **Before**: All reaction data pre-loaded
- **After**: Only load reactions when dialog opens (lazy loading)
- **Impact**: User only pays API cost for exercises they actually view

### Cache Effectiveness
- Static content cached for 4 hours (exercises, paths, repository structure)
- Dynamic content cached for 30 minutes (reactions, comments)
- Cache cleanup runs every 30 minutes to prevent memory leaks

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Console Logging
- Enhanced logging shows cache hits/misses
- Batch processing progress
- API rate limit status after each call
- Clear distinction between cached and fresh data

### Developer Tools
- API Usage Monitor component in settings
- Real-time rate limit tracking
- Visual warnings when approaching limits
- Cache statistics and cleanup reports

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Cache-First Strategy**: Always check cache before making API calls
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Application works even if API limits are hit
3. **User-Controlled Loading**: Users trigger expensive operations (dialog opening)
4. **Smart Batch Sizes**: Different batch sizes for different content types
5. **Error Resilience**: Failed directory requests don't stop the entire load

## Expected Performance Impact

- **Initial Load**: Slightly slower due to batching, but more reliable
- **Navigation**: Much faster due to cached data
- **Dialog Opening**: Small delay for reaction loading (lazy loading)
- **Memory Usage**: Managed through automatic cache cleanup
- **API Sustainability**: Can now handle multiple users and future growth

This optimization strategy should keep the application well under the 60 requests/hour limit while maintaining full functionality and improving the user experience through faster subsequent loads.
