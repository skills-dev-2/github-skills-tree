# GitHub Skills Tree

A visual skill progression platform that gamifies developer growth through GitHub activity and achievements.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Engaging** - Creates excitement around skill development through visual progress tracking
2. **Intuitive** - Clear visual hierarchy makes skill relationships and progress immediately understandable
3. **Motivational** - Celebrates achievements and provides clear paths for continued growth

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Will include skill visualization, progress tracking, and achievement systems with persistent user data

## Essential Features

### Skill Tree Visualization
- **Functionality**: Interactive tree diagram showing interconnected developer skills
- **Purpose**: Provides clear visual roadmap for skill development and dependencies
- **Trigger**: User loads the application or navigates to skills view
- **Progression**: Load app → View skill tree → Click skills for details → See prerequisites and progress
- **Success criteria**: Skills display in logical hierarchy with clear connections and progress indicators

### GitHub Integration
- **Functionality**: Connects to GitHub profile to assess current skill levels
- **Purpose**: Automatically evaluates user's existing capabilities based on repository analysis
- **Trigger**: User authorizes GitHub connection
- **Progression**: Click connect → GitHub OAuth → Analyze repositories → Update skill assessments → Display results
- **Success criteria**: Accurately reflects user's demonstrated skills from their GitHub activity

### Progress Tracking
- **Functionality**: Persistent storage of skill progression and achievements
- **Purpose**: Maintains user motivation through visible progress and milestone tracking
- **Trigger**: Skill assessment updates or manual progress logging
- **Progression**: Skill activity detected → Progress calculated → Visual indicators updated → Achievements unlocked
- **Success criteria**: Progress persists between sessions and reflects actual skill development

## Edge Case Handling
- **No GitHub Profile**: Provide manual skill assessment option for users without public repositories
- **Private Repositories**: Clear messaging about limitations and option to manually claim skills
- **Network Failures**: Graceful degradation with cached data and retry mechanisms
- **Empty Repositories**: Guide users toward creating meaningful projects to demonstrate skills

## Design Direction
The interface should feel like a sophisticated skill development platform - clean, modern, and game-like without being childish, emphasizing growth and achievement through elegant visual design.

## Color Selection
Triadic color scheme to create visual interest while maintaining professional appeal.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - Communicates trust, professionalism, and depth of knowledge
- **Secondary Colors**: Forest Green (oklch(0.55 0.12 140)) for growth and progress indicators, Warm Purple (oklch(0.55 0.12 300)) for achievements and highlights
- **Accent Color**: Bright Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 50)) - Attention-grabbing color for call-to-action buttons and important milestones
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark Gray text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 16.0:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.5:1 ✓  
  - Secondary (Forest Green oklch(0.55 0.12 140)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 6.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Bright Orange oklch(0.70 0.15 50)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey expertise and clarity - using Inter for its technical precision and excellent readability across all sizes.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Skill Categories): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Captions: Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance understanding of skill relationships and progress without overwhelming the interface.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Skill tree connections animate on hover to show dependencies, progress bars fill smoothly to celebrate achievements, gentle fade transitions maintain context during navigation
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Skill nodes get primary animation focus, followed by connection lines, with UI chrome having minimal motion

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Cards for skill nodes, Progress bars for advancement tracking, Tooltips for detailed skill information, Buttons for actions and navigation, Avatar for user profile integration
- **Customizations**: Custom skill tree visualization component using SVG, specialized progress indicators for different skill types, custom achievement badge components
- **States**: Skill nodes (locked/unlocked/completed), Progress indicators (empty/partial/complete), Action buttons (enabled/disabled/loading), Connection states for GitHub integration
- **Icon Selection**: Code-related icons from Phosphor (Code, GitBranch, Trophy, Star) to represent different skill categories and achievements
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit (16px) spacing for major sections, 2-unit (8px) for related elements, 1-unit (4px) for tight groupings
- **Mobile**: Collapsible skill tree with drill-down navigation, simplified progress views, touch-optimized skill node sizing for mobile interaction
