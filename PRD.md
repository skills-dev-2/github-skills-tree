# GitHub Skills Exercise Roadmap PRD

A beautiful minimalistic skills tree visualization for GitHub Skills platform exercises, showing learning paths and dependencies in an interactive, game-like interface.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Intuitive** - Navigation feels natural and discoverable like exploring a skill tree in a video game
2. **Focused** - Clean interface that emphasizes the learning path relationships without visual clutter
3. **Engaging** - Interactive elements that encourage exploration and provide clear progression feedback

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Multiple interactive components with hover states, click interactions, and data visualization while maintaining simplicity in core functionality

## Essential Features

### Interactive Skills Tree
- **Functionality**: Displays exercises as circular nodes connected by paths showing dependencies
- **Purpose**: Visualizes learning progression and relationships between GitHub skills
- **Trigger**: Page load automatically renders the tree
- **Progression**: View tree → Hover for details → Click for full exercise information → Navigate through dependencies
- **Success criteria**: All 50 exercises visible with clear path connections, smooth interactions

### Exercise Details Panel
- **Functionality**: Shows detailed information when hovering/clicking exercise nodes
- **Purpose**: Provides comprehensive exercise information without cluttering the main view
- **Trigger**: Mouse hover or click on exercise node
- **Progression**: Hover node → Panel appears with details → Click to pin panel → Close to return to tree
- **Success criteria**: Details load instantly, panel positioning doesn't obstruct tree navigation

### Path Visualization System
- **Functionality**: Draws connecting lines between related exercises using different colors per learning path
- **Purpose**: Shows learning dependencies and recommended progression routes
- **Trigger**: Renders automatically with tree, highlights on hover
- **Progression**: View connections → Hover path for emphasis → Follow path to see learning sequence
- **Success criteria**: Lines are clean (vertical/horizontal only), colors match path definitions, no visual overlaps

### Status Indicator System
- **Functionality**: Uses icon opacity and visual cues to show exercise status (active, scheduled, tentative)
- **Purpose**: Communicates availability and development progress of exercises
- **Trigger**: Visual state rendered with each node
- **Progression**: Observe status → Understand availability → Plan learning path accordingly
- **Success criteria**: Status clearly distinguishable, consistent visual language across all nodes

## Edge Case Handling
- **Empty Data States**: Graceful fallback when exercise or path files are missing with helpful messages
- **Responsive Scaling**: Tree adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining readability
- **Performance with Large Datasets**: Efficient rendering when exercise count grows beyond 50 items
- **Complex Dependencies**: Clear visual handling when exercises have multiple prerequisites
- **Overlapping Paths**: Smart routing to prevent connection lines from becoming confusing

## Design Direction
The design should evoke the focused intensity of a skill tree from a modern RPG - dark themed with precise geometric connections, clean typography, and satisfying interactive feedback that makes learning feel like progression.

## Color Selection
Custom palette with GitHub-inspired dark theme colors
- **Primary Color**: GitHub Blue (#0969da) - communicates trust and represents the core GitHub brand
- **Secondary Colors**: Deep grays (#21262d, #161b22) for backgrounds and subtle UI elements  
- **Accent Color**: Success Green (#2ea043) for completed/active states and call-to-action highlights
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (#0d1117): Light Gray Text (#f0f6fc) - Ratio 15.2:1 ✓
  - Card (#21262d): Light Gray Text (#f0f6fc) - Ratio 12.8:1 ✓  
  - Primary (#0969da): White Text (#ffffff) - Ratio 5.9:1 ✓
  - Accent (#2ea043): White Text (#ffffff) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should feel technical yet approachable, emphasizing clarity and hierarchy for scanning information quickly.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Page Title): SF Pro Display Semi-Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): SF Pro Display Medium/24px/normal spacing
  - Body (Exercise Names): SF Pro Text Regular/16px/comfortable line height
  - Caption (Status Info): SF Pro Text Regular/14px/muted color

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that guide attention and provide satisfying feedback without being distracting or slowing down interaction.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Hover states expand nodes slightly to show interactivity, path lines glow when highlighted to emphasize connections
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Node interactions take priority, followed by path highlighting, with panel transitions being most subtle

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Card for exercise details panel, Button for navigation, Tooltip for quick info, ScrollArea for tree container
- **Customizations**: Custom SVG skill tree visualization, specialized connection line rendering system
- **States**: Nodes have distinct hover/active/dimmed states, paths highlight on interaction, panels slide in smoothly
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub Octicons for exercise types, geometric shapes for nodes, clean directional indicators for paths
- **Spacing**: 16px base unit, 24px for major sections, 8px for tight groupings
- **Mobile**: Simplified tree layout with touch-friendly interactions, collapsible detail panels, horizontal scrolling for wide trees
