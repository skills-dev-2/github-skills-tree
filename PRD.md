## Design Direction

The design should feel modern and gamified with a tech-forward aesthetic that emphasizes progression and achievement while maintaining professional credibility for a developer tool.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme using GitHub's brand colors as foundation with complementary gaming elements.

- **Primary Color**: GitHub Black (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Communicates professionalism and GitHub brand connection
- **Secondary Colors**: Dark gray backgrounds and subtle borders for depth and hierarchy
- **Accent Color**: GitHub Green (oklch(0.6 0.15 142)) - Highlights completed skills and achievements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Dark text (oklch(0.2 0 0)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Primary (GitHub Black oklch(0.2 0 0)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Accent (GitHub Green oklch(0.6 0.15 142)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Clean, modern typeface that balances readability with technical aesthetic - using Inter for its excellent screen readability and developer tool familiarity.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Skill Names): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Descriptions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Small (Meta info): Inter Regular/14px/normal spacing

## Animations

Subtle and purposeful animations that enhance the gamification feeling without being distracting, focusing on skill unlocking and progress feedback.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Skill unlock animations and progress bars create satisfaction and communicate achievement
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Skill completion gets primary animation focus, navigation transitions are secondary

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Card (skill nodes), Dialog (skill details), Progress (completion tracking), Button (actions), Badge (skill status)
- **Customizations**: Custom skill tree layout component with connecting lines, animated progress indicators
- **States**: Locked/unlocked skills, completed/incomplete status, hover effects for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: GitHub icons for skills, lock/unlock icons for status, progress indicators for completion
